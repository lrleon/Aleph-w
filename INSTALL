In order to install Aleph-w you need the following libraries: gettext,
m4, xutils-dev, libx11-dev, nana, libgsl0-dev, libgmp-dev and
libmpfr-dev. 

Normally these libaries are available from the package manager of your
system (apt-get, portage, etc).

Once installed the base libraries, untar the aleph-w tar file. By
default, untar will create a directory named aleph and will put the
files into it. You can rename the aleph directory or move the files
toward another directory of your preference.

cd to aleph directory and run

   xmkmf


This command (available from x11 library) will create a Makefile. Then
run

   make depend


NEVER EDIT THE MAKEFILE. If you want to modify your configuration, by
example, trying to compile the lib with gcc or icc, then EDIT the
Imakefile and rerun "xmkmf" then "make depend".

Run 

    make libAleph.a


If you want the fastest option, then you can run

    make OPTIONS="-Ofast -D_REENTRANT -DWITHOUT_NANA"


In order to build the tests, run

   make

and run them one by one.
