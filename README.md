# Aleph-w

Aleph-w is a library of data structures and algorithms implemented in
and for C++.

It contains the most popular data structures: single and double lists, special
arrays (dynamic and of bits), many types of trees: multitrees, binary
search trees, avl, red-black, randomized, treaps, splay and other
interesting types.

Several types of hash tables are implemented: separated chaining, open
adressing with linear probing and double function hash; this last one
has a garbage colector mechanism that allows to free deleted
entries. Dynamic linear hash tables are implemented too.

The main algorithms on graphs are implemented in an easy way and with
good performance features. Network Flow (maximum and min cost), cut
points, topological sort, spanning trees, min paths. etc. The graphs
are generic in the sense that they can contain data independent of the
algorithm.

The more popular part of algorithmic related to network flows has been
implemented, including networks with costs.
